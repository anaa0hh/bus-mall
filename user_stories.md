THE MARKETING RESEARCH TEAM:
    As part of the marketing research team, I want the developer to display three images at a time and when the user selects one,the next three will not repeat any of the ones that were just displayed.

    As part of the marketing research team, I want the amount of votes each image recieved to be displayed after an image has been selected 25 times.

    As part of the marketing research team, I also want the developer to display the amount of times each image was displayed as part of the selectable images.

    As part of the marketing research team, I want the developer to make the page look professional and run smoothly.
    



THE DEVELOPER:
    As a developer, I want to be able to debug my code by using well structured console messages.

    As a future developer, I want to create a Bus Mall page as a demonstration of my skills with HTML and CSS.

    As a future developer, I want to carefully design my scripts, so I can understand how to organize and write my code to achieve my goals in interactivity.

    As a future developer, I want to create a simple script for my index.html page using JavaScript, so that I can use the browser to display the results of bus mall to the marketing research team.

    As a developer, I want to manage my code through an online version control system, so I have the ability to work with others,manage my revisions, and keep a thorough record of my progress.



 
THE FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANT:
    As a participant of the focus group, I want the user experience (UX) of Bus Mall to be interactive and simple.
